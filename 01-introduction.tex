\section{Motivation}

The need to reduce pollutant emissions, particularly the oxides of nitrogen, \ce{NO_x}, in order to meet increasingly stringent government regulations spurs efforts in the gas turbine industry to seek cleaner, more environment-friendly combustion concepts.
The production rate of \ce{NO_x} is highly temperature dependent and fuel-lean, premixed combustion is a widely employed technique to keep the adiabatic flame temperature under 1800 K.
However, operating a combustor at such lean conditions results in eaker combustion processes that are highly susceptible to perturbations and combustor instabilities.
This highlights the requirements for robust flame stabilization techniques to sustain combustion at ultra-lean conditions.
The Low Swirl Burner (LSB) design addresses these requirements by providing a low \ce{NO_x} combustor that can operate stably at lean equivalence ratios.
