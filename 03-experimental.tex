\chapter{Experimental Methods and Considerations}

The current chapter details the facilities and apparatus used to study the flame characteristics in a Low Swirl Burner.
The selection and implementation of diagnostic techniques used in this study are explained, as are data analysis methods used to process the acquired data.

\section{LSB configuration}

Two LSB configurations, A and B are tested for this study.
Each LSB configuration is built around a swirler with an outer diameter, \(d_s\) of 38 mm (1.5 in).
Other key dimensions of the swirlers tested for this work are presented in Table \ref{tab:swirlerdimensions}.

Initial testing aimed at velocity field mapping and flame imaging is conducted on Configuration A, while Configuration B is used for a later series of tests aimed at visualizing the flame structure.
The design of these two configurations is discussed in further detail in what follows.

\subsection{Configuration A}

In this configuration, the reactants reach the swirler through a converging nozzle that decreases linearly in diameter from from the inlet diameter of 102 mm (4 in) to the outer diameter of the swirler, 38 mm (1.5 in).
The swirler leads to a constant area nozzle, and is located one diameter upstream of an abrupt area change.
At the area change, the reactants expand from the 38 mm (1.5 in) diameter nozzle into a 115 mm (4.5 in) diameter combustion zone.
The expansion ratio is chosen so as to avoid confinement effects on the centerline flame flow field.\cite{1998-yegian}

The main combustion zone begins at the dump plane and is enclosed by a GE 214 quartz tube.
The quartz tube is 300 mm (12 in) long and 115 mm (4.5 in) in diameter.
The thickness of the quartz tube is 2.5 mm (0.1 in).
Configuration A is illustrated in Figure FIXME.

\subsection{Configuration B}

In this configuration, the reactants approach the swirler through a smoothly contoured nozzle with a high contraction ratio designed to inhibit the formation of thick boundary layers.
The swirler again leads to a constant area nozzle which is FIXME diameters in length.
Following this, the reactants enter the combustion zone.

Unlike in Configuration A, there is no dump plane or quartz tube to provide confinement to the combustion zone.
Further, in this configuration, the annular flow is separately controlled from the central flow, which allows one to control the mass flow split directly, if needed.
Finally, this configuration allows for adjusting the level of turbulence present in the inlet flow by use of a turbulence generator located upstream.

The details of Configuration B are shown in Figure FIXME.

\section{High Pressure Test Rig}

Each of the two configurations is housed in a separate high pressure testing rig with optical access to study the flame.
These rigs consist of an air and fuel supply system, a pressure vessel with adequate optical access and an exhaust system.
The details of each rig are discussed in the following sub-sections.

\subsection{Test Rig A}

Preliminary experiments involving velocity field mapping and flame imaging are conducted in Test Rig A, shown in Figure FIXME.
Preheated air at about 500 K is drawn from external tanks and metered through an orifice flow meter.
The air enters the inlet nozzle of the LSB through a 1.8 m (6 ft) long, 102 mm (4 in) diameter straight pipe section.
Fuel (natural gas) is metered using another orifice flow meter and injected at the head of the straight pipe section.
The straight pipe section allows for the flow to be fully developed, and fully premixed before the reactants enter the burner.
The combustor pressure and temperature are measured at the head of the inlet nozzle by a pressure transducer and a thermocouple respectively.
In addition, the upstream pressure and the pressure differential are measured at the air and fuel orifice flow meters.
For the preheated air stream, the upstream temperature is also measured.
The measurements are used to calculate the four primary flow parameters (combustor pressure, preheat temperature, reference velocity and equivalence ratio) for the LSB in real time.
All measurements are monitored and recorded during the course of the experiment by a LabView VI.

The pressure vessel enclosing the combustor is designed to withstand pressures of up to 30 atm and is insulated from the combustor by a ceramic liner.
Cooling for the pressure vessel and the quartz tube is provided by a flow of cold air introduced at the head of the pressure vessel.
Optical access to the combustor is provided through four 150 mm (6 in) \(\times\) 75 mm (3 in) quartz windows located \(90^\circ\) apart azimuthally.
The view ports allow the combustor to be imaged from the dump plane to an axial distance of 150 mm (6 in) downstream.

The exhaust from the combustor is cooled by circulating cold water through a water jacket enclosing the exhaust pipe section.
The length of the exhaust pipe section is about FIXME.
The exhaust pipe section terminates in an orifice plug to provide the back pressure to the combustion chamber.
Different diameter orifices are used for each reference velocity condition to be tested.
The exiting products are finally released to the building exhaust system.
