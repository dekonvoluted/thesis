\caption[Results of the linearity experiment]{The plot shows the results of the linearity experiment. The LIF signal intensity is measured for a range of input laser energies (expressed here an an intensity). The data points below 1 J/cm\(^2\) are marked in \textcolor{blue}{blue} and fitted to a linear curve. One outlier (\textcolor{red}{red}), along with data points at high laser intensities are not included in the linear fit.}
