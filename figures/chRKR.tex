\caption[Potential curves for the CH system]{The figure shows the RKR potential curves for the \(X^2\Pi\), \(A^2\Delta\) and \(B^2\Sigma^-\) energy levels in the CH system. A few vibrational levels are indicated for the \(X^2\Pi\) and \(A^2\Delta\) states. The \(B^2\Sigma^-\) state has only two bound vibrational levels. The diagram is reproduced from Richmond et al.\cite{2005-richmond} who based it on \emph{ab initio} calculations by van Dishoeck\cite{1987-vandishoeck}}
