\caption[Effect of preheat temperature on the LSB flow field - I]{The plot shows results from LDV mapping of the flow field in the LSB. Mean and rms axial velocity profiles are shown for \textcolor{blue}{cold}, \textcolor{green}{hot}, and \textcolor{red}{reacting} flow fields. The velocities are normalized by the reference velocity, while the abscissa is shifted to align the virtual origins of the profiles.}
