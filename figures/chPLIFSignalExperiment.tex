\caption[Validation of LIF signal model]{The plot compares the experimentally measured LIF signal to the values predicted by the signal model. The experiment is conducted at 1 atm, 300 K on a laminar Bunsen flame burning a methane-air mixture. Two reaction mechanisms (GRI Mech 3.0 and San Diego) are used to generate the relevant data used by the signal model. All three datasets are normalized at the peak value.}
