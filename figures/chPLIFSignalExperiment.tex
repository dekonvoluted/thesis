\caption[Validation of LIF signal model]{The plot above compares the experimentally measured LIF signal to those predicted by the signal model. The experiment is conducted at 1 atm, 300 K on a laminar Bunsen flame burning a methane-air mixture. Two reaction mechanisms are used to generate the relevant data used by the signal model. All three datasets are normalized at the peak value.}
