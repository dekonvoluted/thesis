\caption[Processing of the excitation scan images]{The image above shows a typical instantaneous laminar flame from the excitation scan experiment. Regions of interest are identified on the image corresponding to the window method (\textcolor{green}{green}) and the line method (\textcolor{cyan}{cyan}). The midpoint of the flame sheet is also indicated on the image.}
