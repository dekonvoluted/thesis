\caption[Results of the laser calibration experiment]{The wavelength of the second harmonic beam of the laser is plotted above against the tuner position(\(x\)). The data shows excellent repeatability and falls on a linear trend. The equation for the linear curve fit is \(\lambda = 330.213 + 91.5908x\), where the units of \(\lambda\) and \(x\) are nm and in, respectively.}
