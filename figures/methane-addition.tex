\caption[Syngas-alkane-air flame results - III]{The LIF signal from a pure \ce{H2}-air reactant mixture is shown as a function of increasing \ce{CH4} percentage. The reactants are initially at 300 K and 1 atm. The equivalence ratio of the reactant mixture is held fixed at 0.6 for all cases. The slight scatter in the data points in the 30--50\% \ce{CH4} range is attributed to convergence issues in Chemkin.}
