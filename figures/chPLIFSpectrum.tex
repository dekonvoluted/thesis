\caption[CH PLIF Spectrum]{The spectrum above shows simulated, normalized spectra for the \(B^2\Sigma^-\leftarrow X^2\Pi\) absorption bands (\textcolor{red}{red}) and the \(A^2\Delta\rightarrow X^2\Pi\) excited fluorescence emission bands (\textcolor{blue}{blue}) from LIFBASE. The simulations are carried out at 1 atm, for a thermalized CH population at 1800 K. The resolution of the simulation is 0.3 nm. The actual CH PLIF spectrum was measured using a fiber optic cable, an Ocean Optics HR 2000 spectrometer and a PIMAX 512 intensified camera and accumulated over 1000 exposure gates of 300 ns each. The experiment was performed using the laminar flame burner described in Section \ref{subsubsec:plif-laminar-flame-setup}. The resultant spectrum is shown in \textcolor{black}{black}. The dotted \textcolor{green}{green} curve is the transmittance for the 3 mm thick GG 420 Schott glass filter used to block elastic scattering in imaging experiments.}
