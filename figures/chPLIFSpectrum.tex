\caption[CH PLIF Spectrum]{The spectrum above shows simulated spectra for absorption (\textcolor{red}{red}) and emission (\textcolor{blue}{blue}) from LIFBASE. The simulations are carried out at 1 atm, for a thermalized CH population at 1800 K. The resolution of the simulation is 0.3 nm. The actual CH PLIF spectrum was measured using a fiber optic cable, an Ocean Optics HR 2000 spectrometer and a PIMAX 512 intensified camera and accumulated over 1000 exposure gates of 300 ns each. This is shown in \textcolor{black}{black}. The dotted \textcolor{green}{green} curve is the transmittance for the 3 mm thick GG 420 Schott glass filter used to block elastic scattering.}
