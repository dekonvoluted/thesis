\caption[CH PLIF Spectrum]{FIXME. Portion of the spectrum is shown. Spectrum was recorded from 400 nm to 520 nm. No comparable sources of emission there. FIXME The spectrum above shows simulated, normalized spectra for the \(B^2\Sigma^-\leftarrow X^2\Pi\) absorption bands (\textcolor{red}{red}) and the \(A^2\Delta\rightarrow X^2\Pi\) excited fluorescence emission bands (\textcolor{blue}{blue}) from LIFBASE. Also plotted is the experimentally measured emission spectrum (\textcolor{green}{green}). The dashed \textcolor{black}{black} curve is the transmittance of a 3 mm thick, GG 420 Schott glass filter used to block elastic scattering in imaging experiments.}
