\caption[Effect of preheat temperature on the LSB flow field - II]{The plot shows LDV data from two orthogonal traverses (along \(Y\) and \(Z\) axes) across the LSB combustor. Mean axial velocity (rms, dashed) is plotted for cold and hot cases (both non-reacting) are shown. The rms velocity profiles are plotted using dashed lines. The traverses are performed 15 mm downstream of the inlet.}
