\caption[Effect of temperature on the LSB flow field - II]{The plot above shows LDV data from two orthogonal traverses (along \(Y\) and \(Z\) axes) performed across the LSB combustor. The data is presented for cold and hot cases (both non-reacting) to highlight the effect of preheat on the mean axial velocity profile through the shear layer. The traverses are performed 15 mm downstream of the inlet and use the \(S_{45^\circ}\) swirler in Configuration A.}
