\caption[Transitions in a basic two-level model]{The figure shows energy levels and transitions between two levels, labeled 0 and 1, in a basic model of laser-induced fluorescence. Stimulated absorption and emission are shown in \textcolor{blue}{blue}, collisional quenching is shown in \textcolor{red}{red} and spontaneous emission is shown in \textcolor{green}{green}.}
