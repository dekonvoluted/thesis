\caption[Effect of preheat temperature on the LSB flow field - IV]{The plot shows LDV data from two orthogonal traverses (along \(Y\) and \(Z\) axes) across the LSB combustor. Mean axial velocity (rms, dashed) is plotted for cold and hot cases (both non-reacting). The traverses are performed 75 mm downstream of the inlet.}
