\caption[Effect of preheat temperature on the LSB flow field - IV]{The plot shows LDV data from two orthogonal traverses (along \(Y\) and \(Z\) axes) performed across the LSB combustor. Mean axial velocity is presented for cold and hot cases (both non-reacting) to highlight the effect of preheat on the mean axial velocity profile through the shear layer. The rms velocities are plotted with dashed lines. The traverses are performed 75 mm downstream of the inlet and use the \(S_{45^\circ}\) swirler in Configuration A.}
