\caption[Schematic of LSB flame stabilization]{The figure above illustrates the robustness of the LSB flame stabilization mechanism. The flame is stabilized at the point where the reactant velocity, \(U\), and the turbulent flame speed, \(S_T\), are equal. Perturbations to the flame standoff distance to the left or the right are counteracted by either \(U\) or \(S_T\) respectively making this a stable equilibrium.}
