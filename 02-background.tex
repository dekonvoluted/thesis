\section{CH PLIF Physical Description}

Laser-Induced Fluorescence, or LIF, is a two-step process.
First, a marker species molecule (in this case, CH) in a lower energy state absorbs a photon and transitions to a higher energy state.
The photon in question is provided by a laser and is of a specific energy (or frequency) chosen to match an allowed transition in the target species.
This is followed by several physical processes, of which one pathway of interest leads to the spontaneous deexcitation of the excited molecule, accompanied by the release of a photon.
The dexcitation may take the molecule back to the original ground state or to another energy state.
The choice of the spectral and temporal properties of the excitation photon and the spontaneously emitted photon, together constitute the excitation scheme.

The excitation scheme chosen for this study follows the work done by Li et al.\cite{2007-li-a} who used a ring-cavity, pulsed alexandrite laser to provide excitation in the vicinity of the R-bandhead of the CH \(B^2\Sigma^- \leftarrow X^2\Pi\) (0,0) system.
This bandhead is found at about 387.2 nm and represents transitions from a ground state rotational quantum number of \(N''=7\).
Alexandrite lasers have relatively large bandwidths (a few cm\(^{-1}\) is not uncommon) and hence make it possible to excite several of the neighboring transitions near the bandhead.
From simulations described later in this work, it is found that CH molecules in the ground state \(X^2\Pi\), \(v''=0\) with rotational quantum numbers \(N''\) between 5--9 account for virtually all the absorption that takes place.

Upon excitation, these molecules transition to the second electronically excited \(B^2\Sigma^-\) state and populate the ground state vibrational level (\(v'=0\)).
Since these transitions are in the R-branch, the rotational quantum number increases by +1, resulting in the population of the \(N''\) levels between 6--10.
Now, the following possibilities exist for the excited molecule:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The molecule can undergo inelastic collisions with other molecules, resulting in relaxation in the rotational, vibrational or electronic manifolds.
\item The molecule can spontaneously emit a photon and return to any of the lower energy states.
\item The molecule can experience stimulated emission in the presence of another photon of the appropriate frequency and return to any of the lower energy states.
\item The molecule can experience further excitation either by absorbing a photon or through collisional means.
\item The molecule, having enough activation energy, can react chemically with another species.
\end{enumerate}

Let's examine these potential pathways in greater detail.
The first pathway pertains to relaxation.
The excitation and subsequent population of a higher energy state causes the CH population distribution to deviate from the equilbrium Boltzmann distribution.
The degree of relaxation possible is limited by the lifetime of the energy level the excited species occupy.
The collision-free, radiative lifetime of the \(B\) electronic state is about 300 ns\cite{1996-luque-c}---long enough for sufficient rotational relaxation to occur, but too short for vibrational relaxation.
As a result, we may suppose that the vibrational manifold remains unaffected, while the rotational manifold is relaxed closer to an equilibrium distribution.
The question of the electronic relaxation will be addressed later in this discussion.

The second option available for the excited CH molecule is to spontaneously emit a photon and return to a lower energy state.
The CH system is very strongly diagonal, meaning that transitions resulting in no change to the vibrational quantum number are extremely favored over others.
This means the majority of this spontaneous emission will result from \(B^2\Sigma^-\rightarrow X^2\Pi\)(0,0) and \(B^2\Sigma^-\rightarrow A^2\Delta\)(0,0) deexcitations.
The \(B\rightarrow X\) transition will be nearly resonant with the excitation wavelength, making it hard to observe, while the \(B\rightarrow A\) transition is only a few hundred wavenumbers apart, putting the emission in far IR.
Even setting the difficulty of observing these transitions aside, it is not expected that a significant portion of the excited CH molecules would follow these pathways as it requires an excited CH molecule to remain collision-free for far too long.

The third option is for the CH molecule to experience stimulated emission in the presence of a photon of an appropriate frequqncy.
It is highly unlikely that the apposite photon would have a frequency other than the excitation laser.
The incident laser beam with induce some stimulated emission and deexcite a portion of the CH molecules back through the \(B^2\Sigma^-\rightarrow X^2\Pi\)(0,0) transition to the ground state.
The only other sources of light in the frequencies of interest result from other CH molecules.
Some of these photons will originate from CH* chemiluminescence, while others still will be produced by the laser-induced fluorescence between the \(B\rightarrow X\) states.

As alluded to earlier, it is highly unlikely that these will result in stimulated emission of significant proportions.
Partly, this is due to the spatial distribution of CH in a typical combustion environment.
As mentioned earlier in Chapter FIXME 1, CH molecules are expected to be found only in the very thin reaction zone of the flame.
Further, CH is a minor species and not likely to be found in concentrations in excess of a few parts per million.
This makes is rather unlikely that a spontaneously emitted photon from another CH molecule would encounter another excited CH molecule and induce a stimulated emission pathway.
In other words, we expect the medium to be optically thin to the wavelengths of interest.
We will return to this concept of an optically thin medium in a subsequent section while modeling the CH absorption strength.

The fourth option is for the molecule to experience further excitation from absorbing another photon or through collisions with other energetic molecules.
The \(B^2\Sigma^-\) state is very shallow, possessing only two vibrational levels before the molecule will dissociate.
Thus, this pathway leads to predissociation of the excited CH molecule.

The final option listed above is for the excited CH molecule to attack another species and participate in chemical reactions.
Since the reaction would not have occurred had the CH molecule been in its ground state, this is referred to as a laser-induced chemical reaction.

Having listed all the options, let's return to the first option and resume the discussion on the possibility of electronic energy transfer from the excited \(B^2\Sigma^-\), \(v'=0\) state.
The spacing of the energy levels in the CH system is such that the \(B^2\Sigma^-\), \(v'=0\) state is found to be near-degenerate with the \(A^2\Delta\), \(v=1\) energy level.
Consequently, the \(B^2\Sigma^-\leftrightarrow A^2\Delta\) (0,1) transition is reversible.
Further, recall that CH is a strongly diagonal system with high transition probabilities for transitions involving no change to the vibrational quantum number.
This means that the \(B^2\Sigma^-\leftrightarrow A^2\Delta\) (0,0) transition will be quite strong as well.
Experiments performed by Garland et al.\cite{1985-garland-b} measured that the \(B^2\Sigma^-\rightarrow A^2\Delta\) electronic energy transfers account for almost a quarter of all collisional depletion of the \(B^2\Sigma^-\), \(v=0\) level.

Theoretical calculations using overlap integrals between the involved energy levels predict that a majority of these transfers will be along the diagonal (0,0) transition.\cite{2000-luque}.
Instead, experimental data indicates that the number is closer to a fifth, with almost 80\% of the transfers following the near-degenerate (0,1) pathway.
It is this electronic energy transfer mechanism that enables our excitation scheme to record high quality CH PLIF images.
Having now populated the \(A^2\Delta\) states, the resulting spontaneous emission from the \(A^2\Delta\rightarrow X^2\Pi\) (0,0) and (1,1) transitions can be easily observed between 420--440 nm.
A small portion of the fluorescence in this wavelength range also occurs from the \(B^2\Sigma^-\rightarrow X^2\Pi\), (0,1) transition.
Since these emission wavelengths are at least 30 nm away from the excitation wavelength, a simple glass filter is sufficient to suppress any elastic scattering from the laser beam.

\section{CH PLIF Signal Modeling}
\label{sec:chplifsignalmodel}

We now focus on developing a mathematical model to predict the signal levels obtained from CH PLIF.
Traditionally, a simple two-level model is used for studying the behavior of a fluorescencing molecule.
The development and steady-state solution of this model is covered in various books and review papers.\cite{1997-daily}
Here, we'll merely present the result and limit our discussion to saturation.

The steady state signal from a two-level model is typically expressed as,






In order to calculate the intensity of the quenched CH PLIF signal in a flame, an improved model of the CH system was constructed and analyzed.
According to this new model, CH radicals from the \(X\) ground state are excited to the \(B(0)\) upper state.
This is followed by collisional transfer to the \(A(1)\) and \(A(0)\) states.
The transfer between the nearly degenerate \(A(1)\) and \(B(0)\) states is partially reversible.
The transfer between \(B(0)\) and \(A(0)\) is not reversible.
This is followed by spontaneous emission as CH radicals transition from the \(A\) states to the \(X\) state.
This results in a pseudo-three-level model as shown in Figure FIXME.

Figure FIXME indicates the rates of the various processes discussed.
The subscripts 0, 1 and 2 represent the electronic energy levels \(X\), \(A\) and \(B\) respectively.
Processes involving the \(A(0)\) state are differentiated from those involving the \(A(1)\) state by a prime (').
With the exception of the nearly degenerate \(A(1)\) and \(B(0)\) states, most collisional excitation steps are neglected due to their low probability.

In this formulation, the signal intensity of the CH PLIF emission is given by Equation \ref{eqn:signalIntensity}.

\begin{equation}
S = ( n_1A_{10} + n'_1A'_{10} + n_2A_{20} )V
\label{eqn:signalIntensity}
\end{equation}

The spontaneous emission coefficients, \(A_{10}\), \(A'_{10}\) and \(A_{20}\) are obtained from various published papers\cite{1985-garland-a,1996-luque-b,2005-richmond}.
The values used for this analysis are presented in Table \ref{tab:emissionCoefficients}.

\input{tables/emissionCoefficients}

Equations \ref{eqn:rates1}--\ref{eqn:rates3} describe the time variation of the number density of CH radicals in each excited state.

\begin{align}
\frac{dn_1}{dt} &= -( A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} )n_1 + R_{21}n_2
\label{eqn:rates1}\\
\frac{dn'_1}{dt} &= -( A'_{10} + Q'_{10} )n'_1 + R'_{21}n_2
\label{eqn:rates2}\\
\frac{dn_2}{dt} &= W_{02}n_0 + R_{12}n_1 - ( A_{20} + Q_{20} + R_{21} + R'_{21} )n_2
\label{eqn:rates3}
\end{align}

At steady state, the rate of change of the number density is minimal.
Under this assumption, the LHS of Equations \ref{eqn:rates1}--\ref{eqn:rates3} can be set to zero.
This results in a closed set of linear equations in terms of the populations of the upper states.
This set of equations is presented in Equation \ref{eqn:closedForm}.

\begin{equation}
  \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} & 0 & -R_{21}\\
      0 & A'_{10} + Q'_{10} & -R'_{21}\\
      -R_{12} & 0 & A_{20} + Q_{20} + R_{21} + R'_{21}
    \end{matrix}
  \right]\left[
    \begin{matrix}
      n_1\\
      n'_1\\
      n_2
    \end{matrix}
  \right] = \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      0\\
      0\\
      W_{02}n_0
    \end{matrix}
  \right]
  \label{eqn:closedForm}
\end{equation}

The solution to Equation \ref{eqn:closedForm} is shown in Equations \ref{eqn:solution1}--\ref{eqn:solution3}.

\begin{align}
  n_1 &= \frac{ R_{21} }{ ( A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} )( A_{20} + Q_{20} + R_{21} + R'_{21} ) - R_{12}R_{21} }W_{02}n_0
  \label{eqn:solution1}\\
  n'_1 &= \frac{ ( A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} )R'_{21} }{ ( A'_{10} + Q'_{10} ) ( ( A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} )( A_{20} + Q_{20} + R_{21} + R'_{21} ) - R_{12}R_{21} ) }W_{02}n_0
  \label{eqn:solution2}\\
  n_2 &= \frac{ ( A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} ) }{ ( A_{10} + Q_{10} + R_{12} )( A_{20} + Q_{20} + R_{21} + R'_{21} ) - R_{12}R_{21} }W_{02}n_0
  \label{eqn:solution3}
\end{align}

These expressions can be further simplified by noting various observations made in studies of the CH system.
For instance, previous work\cite{1984-cool,1985-garland-b} has reported that the \(B\) state is slightly (about 1.3 times) more prone to quenching compared to the \(A\) state.
We can thus make the following assumptions.

\begin{gather}
  Q_{10} = Q'_{10} = Q
  \label{eqn:quenchingAssumption1}\\
  Q_{20} = 1.3Q
  \label{eqn:quenchingAssumption2}
\end{gather}

Next, it has been reported\cite{2000-luque} that the electronic energy transfer rate from \(B\) to \(A\) state accounts for 0.24 times the total collisional removal from the \(B\) state.

\begin{gather}
  \frac{ R_{21} + R'_{21} - R_{12} }{ Q_{20} + R_{21} + R'_{21} - R_{12} } = 0.24\\
  \therefore \frac{ R_{21} + R'_{21} - R_{12} }{ Q } = 0.4105
  \label{eqn:REquation1}
\end{gather}

We further know\cite{1985-garland-b, 2000-luque} that the collisional transfer from the \(B(0)\) energy level populates the nearly degenerate \(A(1)\) level about four times faster than the \(A(0)\) level.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{ R_{21} - R_{12} }{ R'_{21} } = 4
  \label{eqn:REquation2}
\end{equation}

Finally, it was observed\cite{1985-garland-b} that the rate of forward transfer from \(B(0)\) to \(A(1)\) is about 1.6 times the reverse process.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{R_{21}}{R_{12}} = 1.6
  \label{eqn:REquation3}
\end{equation}

Collating Equations \ref{eqn:REquation1}--\ref{eqn:REquation3}, we obtain a closed set of linear equations.
This can be solved to eliminate \(R_{21}\), \(R_{12}\) and \(R'_{21}\) in terms of \(Q\) as shown in Equation \ref{eqn:RSolution}.

\begin{equation}
  \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      R_{21}\\
      R'_{21}\\
      R_{12}
    \end{matrix}
  \right] = \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      5.1966\\
      0.4872\\
      3.2479
    \end{matrix}
  \right] Q
  \label{eqn:RSolution}
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations \ref{eqn:quenchingAssumption1}, \ref{eqn:quenchingAssumption2} and \ref{eqn:RSolution} into Equations \ref{eqn:solution1}--\ref{eqn:solution2} leads to simplified expressions for the populations of the upper electronic states purely as a function of the respective Einstein coefficients and the collisional quenching rate.
These are presented in the following Equations \ref{eqn:simplifiedSolution1}--\ref{eqn:simplifiedSolution3}.

\begin{align}
  n_1 &= \frac{ 5.1966Q }{ ( A_{10} + 4.2479Q )( A_{20} + 6.9838Q ) - 16.8780Q } W_{02}n_0
  \label{eqn:simplifiedSolution1}\\
  n'_1 &= \frac{ 0.4872Q( A_{10} + 4.2479Q ) }{ ( A'_{10} + Q ) \left( ( A_{10} + 4.2479Q )( A_{20} + 6.9838Q ) - 16.8780Q \right) } W_{02}n_0
  \label{eqn:simplifiedSolution2}\\
  n_2 &= \frac{ ( A_{10} + 4.2479Q ) }{ ( A_{10} + 4.2479Q )( A_{20} + 6.9838Q ) - 16.8780Q } W_{02}n_0
  \label{eqn:simplifiedSolution3}
\end{align}

The quenching rate, \(Q\) of excited CH radicals is calculated by using the quenching cross-sections of various species.
The quenching cross-sections are measures of the effectiveness of each collision between a given species and an excited CH radical.
The effectiveness of the collision also depends on the velocity of collision between the two species, \(g_j\) and the abundance of the species, \(n_j\).
This relationship is formalized in Equation \ref{eqn:quenchingRate}.

\begin{align}
  Q & =\sum_j g_j \sigma_j n_j \nonumber \\
  Q & = \sum_j \sqrt{\frac{ 8kT }{ \pi\mu_j }} \sigma_j \frac{ pN_A }{ RT } X_j
  \label{eqn:quenchingRate}
\end{align}

In Equation \ref{eqn:quenchingRate}, \(\mu_j\) represents the reduced mass of the colliding CH-\(j\) molecules,\(p\) is the pressure, \(N_A\) is Avogadro's Number, \(R\) is the Universal Gas Constant, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(X_j\) is the mole fraction of species \(j\).
The mole fractions of the various species in the flame, as well as the temperature across the flame are obtained from Chemkin simulations.
The expression for the reduced mass is given in Equation \ref{eqn:reducedMass}.

\begin{equation}
  \mu_j = \frac{ m_j m_{CH} }{ m_j + m_{CH} }
  \label{eqn:reducedMass}
\end{equation}

The quenching cross-sections of various species are obtained from various published papers\cite{1994-chen,1998-tamura,2002-renfro} and are functions of temperature.
The functional forms used in this study are presented in Table \ref{tab:quenchingCrossSections}.

\input{tables/quenchingCrossSections}

The term \(W_{02}n_0\) in Equations \ref{eqn:simplifiedSolution1}--\ref{eqn:simplifiedSolution3} represents the rate of pumping of the ground state CH radicals.
The current excitation scheme targets multiple transitions in the R-bandhead.
The pumping rate for each transition is the product of the number of CH radicals present in the appropriate level, the Einstein absorption coefficient for that energy level, \(B_i\) and the amount of laser energy available at the appropriate frequency, \(E_i\).
As a result, the term is actually a summation over the individual energy levels.
Equation \ref{eqn:pumpingRate} presents this symbolically.

\begin{align}
  W_{02}n_0 &= \sum_i B_i I_i n_i \nonumber \\
  W_{02}n_0 &= \sum_i B_i \frac{ E_i }{ A_c } \frac{ pN_A X_{CH} }{ RT } f_i
  \label{eqn:pumpingRate}
\end{align}

Table \ref{tab:absorptionCoefficients} presents the values of \(B_i\) for the transitions targeted by the current excitation scheme.\cite{1996-luque-c}
Assuming a Gaussian line shape for the laser, and using the line strengths from LIFBASE, the relative amount of energy absorbed by each transition can be calculated.
These values are also presented in Table \ref{tab:absorptionCoefficients}.

\input{tables/absorptionCoefficients}

In Equation \ref{eqn:pumpingRate}, \(A_c\) is the area of cross-section of the laser beam and \(f_i\) is the Boltzmann fraction of the population at the energy level \(i\).
The expression for the Boltzmann fraction at the energy level corresponding to the vibrational quantum number \(v\) and rotational quantum number \(J\) is given in Equation \ref{eqn:BoltzmannFraction}.

\begin{equation}
  f(v,J) = \frac{ \exp{\left(\dfrac{-hcE_v(v)}{kT}\right)} (2J + 1)\exp{\left(\dfrac{-hcE_r(v, J)}{kT}\right)} }{ Q_{rv} }
  \label{eqn:BoltzmannFraction}
\end{equation}

The vibrational energy, \(E_v(v)\) of a level is calculated according to Equation \ref{eqn:vibrationalEnergy}, while the rotational energy, \(E_r(v, J)\) is calculated according to Equation \ref{eqn:rotationalEnergy}.

\begin{align}
  E_v(v) &= \omega_e \left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right) - \omega_ex_e \left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \omega_ey_e \left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 - \omega_ez_e \left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right)^4
  \label{eqn:vibrationalEnergy}\\
  E_r(v, J) &= \left\{B_e - \alpha_e \left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right\}J(J+1) - \left\{D_e + \beta_e \left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right\}J^2(J+1)^2
  \label{eqn:rotationalEnergy}
\end{align}

The spectroscopic constants in Equations \ref{eqn:vibrationalEnergy} and \ref{eqn:rotationalEnergy} are found in literature\cite{1995-zachwieja} and are provided here in Table \ref{tab:spectroscopicConstants}.

\input{tables/spectroscopicConstants}

The rovibrational partition function, \(Q_{rv}\) is a summation over all available vibrational and rotational levels in the particular electronic state.
For the ground state of the CH molecule, there are five available vibrational quantum numbers, \(v = 0\) to \(v = 4\).
The CH system falls under Hund's Case b and hence, the appropriate rotational quantum number to use is \(N\).
Each vibrational level has twenty-two possible values for \(N\) from \(N = 1\) to \(N = 22\).
For each rotational quantum number \(N\), there are two possible values of \(J\) given by \(N \pm \frac{1}{2}\).


\section{Linearity}

In the weak excitation limit, the signal is a function of CH concentration and the rate of collisional quenching of the excited CH radicals.
In the strong excitation limit, the signal depends only on the CH concentration is unaffected by the quenching of the excited CH species.

It is difficult to ensure that the CH system is saturated spatially, temporally and spectrally at the same time.
Further, operating with high laser intensities may bleach the energy levels being excited by inducing chemical reactions that destroy the excited CH radicals.
Hence, it is preferred to operate in the linear regime.
